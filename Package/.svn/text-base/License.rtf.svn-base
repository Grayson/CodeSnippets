\f0\fs24 \cf0 Code Snippets is a plugin for an undocumented plugin architecture.  From Concentrate Software makes no warranty concerning its use.  If you install Code Snippets, you do so at your own risk.\
\
That said, it has poured sugar in my gas tank only once during testing.\
\
If Code Snippets doesn't work as expected, feel free to complain to From Concentrate Software (contact info on previous page) or, better yet, alter the source code (should be included with this installer) and submit a patch.}
